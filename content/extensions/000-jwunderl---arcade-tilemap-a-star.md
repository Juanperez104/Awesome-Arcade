Help your sprites find their way around your tilemaps with this extension! Just provide 2 locations on a tilemap, and it will automagically compute the fastest path between the 2 spots while also moving around walls using the [A\* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)! This will add another section in the Scene category called Path Following in the toolbox.
