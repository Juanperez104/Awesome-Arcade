Playing MakeCode Arcade games with friends can be hard to do without a second device, without the split-screen extension! This extension allows the user to split the screen into not two, but now four cameras, each following a different sprite! The cameras can be reassigned to different regions of the screen, and the scene camera blocks have been replicated in this extension! The extension adds a `Split screen` category to the toolbox.
