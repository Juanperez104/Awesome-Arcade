Play beautiful melodies encoded in the RTTTL language in MakeCode with this extension! A quick Google search will turn up many online websites that can convert your `.midi` files into a RTTTL-compatible string of text! This extension adds a block in the `Melody` section in the `Music` category in the toolbox.
