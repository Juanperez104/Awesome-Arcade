Easy access to a 8x8 tilemap in blocks! Note: If you're switching from a 16x16 to a 8x8 tilemap, don't forget to switch tiles in your code! And delete the 16x16 tiles in the tilemap editor, otherwise you're going to get really confused. This will add a block under the `Tiles` section in the `Scene` category.
