Shows and scrolls notifications like a sprite-say dialog but _s c r e t c h e d_ out! It also supports variable speed and 8x8 icons! (Although it doesn't push notifications down when you display more than one at a time - you need to wait until the current notification is over otherwise you will cover it up - but there are blocks to wait for the notification to finish) This adds a category called `Notification`.
