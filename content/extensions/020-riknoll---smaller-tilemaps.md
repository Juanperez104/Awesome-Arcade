Now we get 4x4, 2x2, and "1x1, at your own risk" tilemaps! Initialize a tilemap and use 4x4 or 2x2 or 1x1 images to manually draw your tiles by code. Note this extension was made in 1 hour, so it may be buggy and performance will not be as good as a 8x8 or 16x16 tilemap. This will add a `Smaller Tilemaps` category.
