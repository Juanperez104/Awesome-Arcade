This small extension adds a category called `Delta` which has a single block that exposes the delta time function in blocks, so projects that rely movement or time based on frames can work when the game is running slower than expected! Make sure to look at the [example](https://makecode.com/_Y0j7ef139dmo) on how to use it!
