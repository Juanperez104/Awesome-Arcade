The default sprite overlap and tilemap overlap blocks are called for every frame it is happening, which can lead to unexpected results. You can use a state variable to only run code when you start and stop overlapping sprites/tiles/areas, but that is annoying. This extension adds new blocks which make it great for advanced tilemap games or making sprite overlaps easier! This adds a category called `Sprite Events`.
