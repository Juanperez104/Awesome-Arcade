This extension is a much more advanced and highly customizable version of (the now depreciated) `arcade-custom-menu` that has tons of options to customize your menus to fit your game's theme! The menu is also a sprite, which allows you to use all standard sprite blocks on it. This adds a category to the toolbox called `Mini Menu`.
