This extension provides blocks to use calculus, linear algebra, cryptography, exponentials and logarithms, and dealing with trigonometry. Also, the calculus blocks look incredibly funny so I recommend checking them out. This extension adds five categories: `Cryptography`, `Calculus`, `Exponential/Log`, `Trig Modes`, and `LinearAlgebra` to the toolbox.
