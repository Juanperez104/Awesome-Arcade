Hey, welcome to Awesome Arcade's developer blog!

In this blog, I will be writing about all things related to MakeCode Arcade, including games, extensions, tools, tips and tricks, and experiences developing in MakeCode Arcade.

I've also implemented an [RSS feed](/rss.xml) - you should subscribe to that. üòâ

I promise the next blog post will have more content than this! (I mean, there isn't that much to say in a first blog post ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
