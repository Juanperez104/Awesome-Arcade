The June 2024 mini game jam - "board games" - has ended! (I know this is a bit late, I was on vacation, and no way I'm writing a blog post on my phone.) You can rewatch the stream on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eancs4EXNP4) and the previous blog post detailing this mini game jam [here](/blog/Mini-Game-Jam-20---Board-Game-Jam).

As it is a mini game jam, there is no placing - everyone is a winner!

## Submissions

Here is a list of all the submissions to this mini game jam! Ordered by order played on stream.

### dice game by [@richard](https://forum.makecode.com/u/richard)

An implementation of [Yacht (the dice game)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht_(dice_game)>) plus extras that was the basis for the more well-known game [Yahtzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee), @richard made it for his mom. You can see him play through it at [timestamp 4:03 in the stream](https://youtu.be/eancs4EXNP4?t=243).

### [Tarot - Card Kit Example](https://forum.makecode.com/t/announcement-makecode-arcade-mini-game-jam-20-board-game-jam/29077/20?u=unsignedarduino) by [@sylvancircle](https://forum.makecode.com/u/sylvancircle)

To demo their awesome card kit extension, (which is listed on Awesome Arcade üòÅ) @sylvancircle created a [Tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot) game example that Richard plays through at [timestamp 9:07](https://youtu.be/eancs4EXNP4?t=547). Although I have no idea what the team is talking about when it comes to Tarot cards, it is an awesome demonstration of how to create a non-standard deck with their extension while also having beautiful artwork! You can play through the example [here](https://arcade.makecode.com/S11717-82768-26828-94780).

### [BoardGame.EXE](https://forum.makecode.com/t/announcement-makecode-arcade-mini-game-jam-20-board-game-jam/29077/37?u=unsignedarduino) by [@Glitch_Trap](https://forum.makecode.com/u/Glitch_Trap)

At [11:15](https://youtu.be/eancs4EXNP4?t=675), @Glitch_Trap's submission is played through which has an amazing screen glitch effect, lore, and instructions! This is my favorite quote from the game:

Its camera system (yes, a "board game" game having a camera system is wild) reminds me of FNAF games...not creepy at all. Since I do not have an ounce of courage to play horror games, I will be playing this game in broad daylight only... If you want to play this suspiciously ominous game you can play it [here](https://arcade.makecode.com/S63917-12017-34856-31070).

### [ùìïùì™ùì∑ùìΩùì™ùìºùîÇ ùì¶ùì™ùìª (sounds)](https://forum.makecode.com/t/announcement-makecode-arcade-mini-game-jam-20-board-game-jam/29077/42?u=unsignedarduino) by [@Rune](https://forum.makecode.com/u/Rune)

The forum post linked has a trove of information explaining how to play this two-player game with cute sprites and sounds! (This is a great opportunity to use MakeCode Arcade's online multiplayer feature!) I really like the concept of this game and think it can be expanded on much more, even with AI players if you can devise a strategy.

You can see Richard and Thomas play it out at [20:33](https://youtu.be/eancs4EXNP4?t=1233). And if you have a spare ten minutes and a friend, you can play it [here](https://arcade.makecode.com/24179-37258-32360-87033).

### [Color War](https://forum.makecode.com/t/announcement-makecode-arcade-mini-game-jam-20-board-game-jam/29077/45?u=unsignedarduino) by @[MichaelsMakecode](https://forum.makecode.com/u/MichaelsMakecode)

Richard and Sarah play this intriguing and addictive two-player game at timestamp [31:01](https://youtu.be/eancs4EXNP4?t=1861). Check out the forum post for instructions or dive head first with trial-and-error into the game [here](https://arcade.makecode.com/S74483-39971-42656-39293).

### [War!](https://forum.makecode.com/t/announcement-makecode-arcade-mini-game-jam-20-board-game-jam/29077/46?u=unsignedarduino) by [@AlexK](https://forum.makecode.com/u/alexk)

This famous multiplayer-required card game is amazingly implemented by @AlexK and is played at timestamp [38:33](https://youtu.be/eancs4EXNP4?t=2313). It even supports up to four players! But for some reason, this [game](https://arcade.makecode.com/81607-84550-51875-74974) has jokers as the highest card... ü§î

### [puzzle pandemonium](https://forum.makecode.com/t/announcement-makecode-arcade-mini-game-jam-20-board-game-jam/29077/52?u=unsignedarduino) by [@pecan4](https://forum.makecode.com/u/pecan4)

A port of [Puzzle Panel 2](https://www.mariowiki.com/Puzzle_Panel) and [Puzzle Panic 1](https://www.mariowiki.com/Puzzle_Panic) is brought to MakeCode Arcade! I am _terrible_ at this [game](https://arcade.makecode.com/S77148-44762-35521-78920) haha...Richard seems to have more experience at [43:11](https://youtu.be/eancs4EXNP4?t=2591)...

### [Card Delver v0-32-2 selection bug fixes](https://forum.makecode.com/t/announcement-makecode-arcade-mini-game-jam-20-board-game-jam/29077/56?u=unsignedarduino) by [@Luke](https://forum.makecode.com/u/Luke)

The highly anticipated _Card Delver_ game (essentially [Slay the Spire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slay_the_Spire)) by @Luke has been submitted to this mini game jam - the cards and animations are just beautiful! (I could probably stare at the artwork for hours) I highly recommend that you check this [game](https://arcade.makecode.com/S37263-31826-07602-14643) out or watch Richard play this game at [timestamp 46:51](https://youtu.be/eancs4EXNP4?t=2811).

### [The MakeCode Forums 0.5: The Wratch of Vortex](https://forum.makecode.com/t/announcement-makecode-arcade-mini-game-jam-20-board-game-jam/29077/47?u=unsignedarduino) by [@ChimbroDaPro](https://forum.makecode.com/u/ChimbroDaPro)

Another highly anticipated game, the prequel to the original [ MakeCode Forums](https://forum.makecode.com/t/the-makecode-forums-arcade-makecode-superheroes-in-my-community-game-jam-submission/24994?u=unsignedarduino) is a randomized turn game similar to DnD that Richard plays at [56:45](https://youtu.be/eancs4EXNP4?t=3405). The lore and artwork is irresistible, so check out the game [here](https://arcade.makecode.com/92295-72919-49266-41350).

These were all great games that all deserve your time to play, so when you have some spare time, you should go check them out. I personally cannot wait for the next mini game jam and its results...
