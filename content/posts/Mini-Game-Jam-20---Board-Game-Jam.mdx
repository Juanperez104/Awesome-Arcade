The June 2024 mini game jam theme has been released - board games! Check out the [forum post](https://forum.makecode.com/t/announcement-makecode-arcade-mini-game-jam-20-board-game-jam/29077?u=unsignedarduino) for more information and rules.

The theme "board game" for this mini game jam is for you to implement any games you could typically play together with friends/family at a table without devices, like card or dice-based games!

***

Some good examples of games that match this theme:

* Virtual card games like Slay the Spire, Hearthstone, and Balatro
* Games with dice mechanics like Dicey Dungeons, Citizen Sleeper, and Slice and Dice
* Board games like Mario Party 1 and this weird N64 Rugrats game 3 that my brother and I always rented from Blockbuster for some reason and I have super clear childhood memories of even though it's probably terrible

And of course any games that recreate classic games like mahjong, solitaire, yahtzee, etc.

It's funny how this month's mini game jam theme parallels the [weekly discussion topics](https://forum.makecode.com/t/weekly-topic-favorite-board-game/29067?u=unsignedarduino).

Submissions are due on Monday, June 24th 2024 at 11:59 PM PDT and are to be submitted to the same [forum post](https://forum.makecode.com/t/announcement-makecode-arcade-mini-game-jam-20-board-game-jam/29077?u=unsignedarduino).

Good luck! (I might personally go for a chess or card game...speaking of which, if you are making a card game, [@alexszeto](https://github.com/alexszeto) on GitHub has a [card game extension](https://github.com/alexszeto/card-kit) that will be very helpful - search it up on the Awesome Arcade Extensions page for more information!)
