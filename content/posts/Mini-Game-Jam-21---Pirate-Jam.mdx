The July 2024 mini game jam theme has been released - pirates! Check out the [forum post](https://forum.makecode.com/t/announcement-makecode-arcade-mini-game-jam-21-pirate-jam/29544?u=unsignedarduino) for more information and rules. (I know this is a bit late, I was on vacation, and no way I'm writing a blog post on my phone.)

The theme "pirates" for this ini game jam is pretty obvious - just make it related to our favorite sea marauders!

      I think this one is pretty self-explanatory, but just in case, we’re
      talking about everyone’s favorite brigands. Y’know the ones! Shanties? Big
      boat? Black flag with a skull on it? Pirates!
