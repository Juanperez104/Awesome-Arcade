This tool will also convert you images to Arcade code, but it also supports using 16-color palettes, in case you don't want to use the default palette! Simply copy the output, open JavaScript mode, navigate to where you want the image to go, and paste away! You may need to remove some redundant characters. Remember that Arcade has a maximum image size of 500x500!
