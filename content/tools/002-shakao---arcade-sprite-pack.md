Have a bunch of images you want to send to someone, but they hate exercising their pinkie and pointer finger? This will convert a set of images into a MakeCode project that, when you import, will put the images into the image gallery! This tool also supports animations, tiles, and tilemaps, as well as exporting an Arcade image to a real image!
