@jacobcarpenter [on GitHub](https://github.com/jacobcarpenter) has written a neat tool that scrapes the [MakeCode Forum's arcade section](https://forum.makecode.com/c/share-your-arcade-projects-here/5) and shows the games in a gallery-like view! So you don't have to suffer I mean, scroll through debug programs and tons of comments to find that dang link. You can also view the most liked-games of all-time and by author, like [me](https://games-gallery.jacobcarpenter.com/author/416) for example hehe.
